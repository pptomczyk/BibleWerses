1.  Praise the LORD! Praise the LORD, O my soul! 
2.  While I live I will praise the LORD; I will sing praises to my God while I have my being. 
3.  Do not put your trust in princes, [Nor] in a son of man, in whom [there is] no help. 
4.  His spirit departs, he returns to his earth; In that very day his plans perish. 
5.  Happy [is he] who [has] the God of Jacob for his help, Whose hope [is] in the LORD his God, 
6.  Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that [is] in them; Who keeps truth forever, 
7.  Who executes justice for the oppressed, Who gives food to the hungry. The LORD gives freedom to the prisoners. 
8.  The LORD opens [the eyes of] the blind; The LORD raises those who are bowed down; The LORD loves the righteous. 
9.  The LORD watches over the strangers; He relieves the fatherless and widow; But the way of the wicked He turns upside down. 
10.  The LORD shall reign forever -- Your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the LORD!
