1.  A Song of Ascents. Out of the depths I have cried to You, O LORD; 
2.  Lord, hear my voice! Let Your ears be attentive To the voice of my supplications. 
3.  If You, LORD, should mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? 
4.  But [there is] forgiveness with You, That You may be feared. 
5.  I wait for the LORD, my soul waits, And in His word I do hope. 
6.  My soul [waits] for the Lord More than those who watch for the morning -- [Yes, more than] those who watch for the morning. 
7.  O Israel, hope in the LORD; For with the LORD [there is] mercy, And with Him [is] abundant redemption. 
8.  And He shall redeem Israel From all his iniquities.
