1.  [A Psalm] of David. I will praise You with my whole heart; Before the gods I will sing praises to You. 
2.  I will worship toward Your holy temple, And praise Your name For Your lovingkindness and Your truth; For You have magnified Your word above all Your name. 
3.  In the day when I cried out, You answered me, [And] made me bold [with] strength in my soul. 
4.  All the kings of the earth shall praise You, O LORD, When they hear the words of Your mouth. 
5.  Yes, they shall sing of the ways of the LORD, For great [is] the glory of the LORD. 
6.  Though the LORD [is] on high, Yet He regards the lowly; But the proud He knows from afar. 
7.  Though I walk in the midst of trouble, You will revive me; You will stretch out Your hand Against the wrath of my enemies, And Your right hand will save me. 
8.  The LORD will perfect [that which] concerns me; Your mercy, O LORD, [endures] forever; Do not forsake the works of Your hands.
