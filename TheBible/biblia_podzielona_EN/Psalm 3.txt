1.  A Psalm of David when he fled from Absalom his son. LORD, how they have increased who trouble me! Many [are] they who rise up against me. 
2.  Many [are] they who say of me, "[There is] no help for him in God." Selah 
3.  But You, O LORD, [are] a shield for me, My glory and the One who lifts up my head. 
4.  I cried to the LORD with my voice, And He heard me from His holy hill. Selah 
5.  I lay down and slept; I awoke, for the LORD sustained me. 
6.  I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people Who have set [themselves] against me all around. 
7.  Arise, O LORD; Save me, O my God! For You have struck all my enemies on the cheekbone; You have broken the teeth of the ungodly. 
8.  Salvation [belongs] to the LORD. Your blessing [is] upon Your people. Selah
