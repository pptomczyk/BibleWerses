1.  A Song of Ascents. Of David. LORD, my heart is not haughty, Nor my eyes lofty. Neither do I concern myself with great matters, Nor with things too profound for me. 
2.  Surely I have calmed and quieted my soul, Like a weaned child with his mother; Like a weaned child [is] my soul within me. 
3.  O Israel, hope in the LORD From this time forth and forever.
