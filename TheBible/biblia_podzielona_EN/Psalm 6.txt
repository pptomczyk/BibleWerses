1.  To the Chief Musician. With stringed instruments. On an eight-stringed harp. A Psalm of David. O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger, Nor chasten me in Your hot displeasure. 
2.  Have mercy on me, O LORD, for I [am] weak; O LORD, heal me, for my bones are troubled. 
3.  My soul also is greatly troubled; But You, O LORD -- how long? 
4.  Return, O LORD, deliver me! Oh, save me for Your mercies' sake! 
5.  For in death [there is] no remembrance of You; In the grave who will give You thanks? 
6.  I am weary with my groaning; All night I make my bed swim; I drench my couch with my tears. 
7.  My eye wastes away because of grief; It grows old because of all my enemies. 
8.  Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity; For the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping. 
9.  The LORD has heard my supplication; The LORD will receive my prayer. 
10.  Let all my enemies be ashamed and greatly troubled; Let them turn back [and] be ashamed suddenly.
