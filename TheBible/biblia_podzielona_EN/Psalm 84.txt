1.  To the Chief Musician. On an instrument of Gath. A Psalm of the sons of Korah. How lovely [is] Your tabernacle, O LORD of hosts! 
2.  My soul longs, yes, even faints For the courts of the LORD; My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God. 
3.  Even the sparrow has found a home, And the swallow a nest for herself, Where she may lay her young -- [Even] Your altars, O LORD of hosts, My King and my God. 
4.  Blessed [are] those who dwell in Your house; They will still be praising You. Selah 
5.  Blessed [is] the man whose strength [is] in You, Whose heart [is] set on pilgrimage. 
6.  [As they] pass through the Valley of Baca, They make it a spring; The rain also covers it with pools. 
7.  They go from strength to strength; [Each one] appears before God in Zion. 
8.  O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer; Give ear, O God of Jacob! Selah 
9.  O God, behold our shield, And look upon the face of Your anointed. 
10.  For a day in Your courts [is] better than a thousand. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God Than dwell in the tents of wickedness. 
11.  For the LORD God [is] a sun and shield; The LORD will give grace and glory; No good [thing] will He withhold From those who walk uprightly. 
12.  O LORD of hosts, Blessed [is] the man who trusts in You!
