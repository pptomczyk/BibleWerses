1.  A Psalm of Thanksgiving. Make a joyful shout to the LORD, all you lands! 
2.  Serve the LORD with gladness; Come before His presence with singing. 
3.  Know that the LORD, He [is] God; [It is] He [who] has made us, and not we ourselves; [We are] His people and the sheep of His pasture. 
4.  Enter into His gates with thanksgiving, [And] into His courts with praise. Be thankful to Him, [and] bless His name. 
5.  For the LORD [is] good; His mercy [is] everlasting, And His truth [endures] to all generations.
