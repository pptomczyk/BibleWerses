1.  A Contemplation of David. A Prayer when he was in the cave. I cry out to the LORD with my voice; With my voice to the LORD I make my supplication. 
2.  I pour out my complaint before Him; I declare before Him my trouble. 
3.  When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, Then You knew my path. In the way in which I walk They have secretly set a snare for me. 
4.  Look on [my] right hand and see, For [there is] no one who acknowledges me; Refuge has failed me; No one cares for my soul. 
5.  I cried out to You, O LORD: I said, "You [are] my refuge, My portion in the land of the living. 
6.  Attend to my cry, For I am brought very low; Deliver me from my persecutors, For they are stronger than I. 
7.  Bring my soul out of prison, That I may praise Your name; The righteous shall surround me, For You shall deal bountifully with me."
