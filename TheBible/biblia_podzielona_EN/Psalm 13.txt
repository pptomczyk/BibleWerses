1.  To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me? 
2.  How long shall I take counsel in my soul, [Having] sorrow in my heart daily? How long will my enemy be exalted over me? 
3.  Consider [and] hear me, O LORD my God; Enlighten my eyes, Lest I sleep the [sleep of] death; 
4.  Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him"; [Lest] those who trouble me rejoice when I am moved. 
5.  But I have trusted in Your mercy; My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation. 
6.  I will sing to the LORD, Because He has dealt bountifully with me.
